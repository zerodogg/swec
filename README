This is SWEC - Simple Web Error Checker.

SWEC is a program that automates testing of dynamic websites.  You provide it
with a base URL, it then parses each HTML file it finds on that site for links,
and if those are within the site specified (ie. local links, not external), it
will check those as well (in this respect it is a lot like a crawler, more on
that later). It will then parse the pages looking for known errors and report
those (such as Mason or PHP errors), and will report if a page can not be read
(by either returning a 404, 500 or similar).

Since you may often want SWEC to be logged in on your site, you have to be
careful. When logged in, SWEC will still click on all links it finds, including
things like 'join group' or 'delete account' (though it has some magic trying
to avoid the latter). Therefore it is highly recommended that when you run SWEC
as a logged-in user on a site, use a test server, not the live one.

Running SWEC on a live site without being logged in as a user is perfectly
fine, it won't do anything a normal crawler wouldn't do (well, not exactly
true, SWEC will ignore robots.txt).

It also has various helpers to assist with some other basic debugging tasks,
such as a cookie-supporting version of lwp-request's HEAD and GET commands.
