About
---

SWEC is a program that automates testing of dynamic websites.  It parses each
HTML file it finds for links, and if those links are within the site specified
(ie. local, not external), it will check that page as well. In this respect it
works a lot like a crawler, in that it'll click on any link it finds (more
notes about this later).

In addition to parsing and locating links, it will also parse the pages looking
for known errors and report those (such as Mason or PHP errors), and will
report if a page can not be read (by either returning a 404, 500 or similar).

Since you may often want SWEC to be logged in on your site, you have to be
careful. When logged in, SWEC will still click on all links it finds, including
things like 'join group' or 'delete account' (though it has some magic trying
to avoid the latter). Therefore it is highly recommended that when you run SWEC
as a logged-in user on a site, use a test server, not the live one.

Running SWEC on a live site without being logged in as a user is perfectly
fine, it won't do anything a normal crawler wouldn't do (well, not exactly
true, SWEC will ignore robots.txt).

It also has various helpers to assist with some other basic debugging tasks,
such as a cookie-supporting version of lwp-request's HEAD and GET commands.
