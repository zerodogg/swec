# Default error checks for SWEC
# 
# All error checks that are bundled with SWEC should be prefixed with SWEC_.
# This is so that:
# 1) They can be easily distinguished from user supplied rules, and bug reports
#    go to the right place
# 2) To allow the user to have a relatively uncluttered namespace in which
#    to define their own rules
