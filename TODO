TODO list for SWEC in no particular order:
- Better handling of URLs with #
- Better skipping of unknown URIs
- More checks
- Support for running each page through the W3C HTML validator
- Support for running as a linkchecker, making sure all links, CSS files and images exist
- Add an S modifier to the regex test, replaces some characters (:,- at least)
    with the /s regex (but with * instead of +). Should make ie. the test for
    SWEC_PHP_SYNTAX more readable
