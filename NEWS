SWEC 0.5
----------
- Added --postseed, allows testing of URLs that need POSTed data, as well as
	logging into sites that only accept POSTed login credentials.
- Removed the deprecated --hardpagelimit and --softpagelimit parameters
- Added support for encoding URI strings with URI::Encode
- Added --disable-lib to let the user disable use of various optional libs
- Added support for //-urls
- Updated user agent strings, added --chrome and --android
- New tests: SWEC_CRASHEDTABLE, SWEC_SQL_ERROR
- Updated tests: SWEC_PHP_SYNTAX, SWEC_PHP_DB

SWEC 0.4.1
----------
- Fixed a bug that could cause SWEC to crash if a server went offline during
	testing

SWEC 0.4
----------
- Smarter seed/baseurl parsing. SWEC now lets you specify seeds before the
	baseurl (allowing things like "swec example.org -s /some.html").
- No longer outputs needless assumption messages
- Documentation improvements
- Moved to a new version of the SDF format (SDFv2) that is more flexible,
	easier to extend and faster (pre-compiles regexes)
- Added --checksub, option to allow SWEC to descend into subdomains
- URL generation cleanups
- Added --noignore
- Code cleanups
- Fixed a bug causing SWEC to fail when user-supplied URLs contained port
	numbers and the URLs was not supplied as explicit seeds, but alone
	on the command-line.
- Added basic automated tests for SWEC
- --softpagelimit and --hardpagelimit has been deprecated, and they now
	default to no value. The options will be removed in 0.5. The old
	default was equivalent to --softpagelimit 20 --hardpagelimit 30.
	--harderrorlimit is unaffacted by this change and is not deprecated.

SWEC 0.3
--------
- Fixed a bug causing --help to display the --help-all list instead of the
	smaller --help list
- Fixed a bug that could cause external links to be counted towards --matchmax
- Fixed a bug where links could potentially be matched towards --matchmax more
	than once
- Cleaned up the user agent
- The command now returns nonzero when a test fails
- Fixed a bug causing SWEC to try to run tests on an empty string when there's
	a connection error
- Made the final summary a bit cleaner
- New tests: SWEC_PHP_SYNTAX SWEC_URI_HTMLENTITY SWEC_CAKE_GENERICERROR
    SWEC_PHP_FAILEDFUNCTION
- Added --nohead - tells SWEC to skip sending HEAD requests and go straight
	to the GET request
- No longer requires HTML::LinkExtractor (but will use it if it's available)
- Will now emit a SWEC_INT_CONNECTIONERROR error when connections fail
- Fixed a crash when using 'regex' tests
- Added --keepgoing - tells swec to parse a page for links even if
	it contained an error

SWEC 0.2.1
----------
- Minor fixes and enhancements to various tests.
- Ensured that Mason tests are run after other relevant tests so that
    errors from toolkits using mason for templating are properly
    caught.
- Now displays the error name while running the test so that it is possible
    to know something about the errors occurring before the summary is printed.
- Will now retry up to three times if a connection is refused or reset by peer
- Made the status information while running easier to read by imposing a minimum
    width and stripping out the domain/hostname
- Added --matchmax - a flexible way to make SWEC only test a predefined number
	of pages matching a regular expression
- Added --lwphead and --lwpget parameters, which is basically the lwp-request
	HEAD and GET commands, with cookie support

SWEC 0.2
--------
- Now has one error code for each HTTP error (ie. SWEC_INT_HTTP_404)
	instead of the generic SWEC_INT_FETCHFAILED. This lets you filter out
	things like HTTP 404 errors, which might not be actual errors, but
	rather the desired behaviour in some cases.
- Seeds will now be checked in the order supplied on the commandline.
	This allows you to first run a login page and then visit pages that
	swec would otherwise not pick up (ie. because the links are generated
	by JavaScript).
- Now skips pages based on content-type, not just extension
- New tests: SWEC_DBI_ERROR SWEC_DBIXC_ERROR SWEC_PERL_CARP SWEC_PHP_DB
			SWEC_PHP_MAXCONN SWEC_URI_PERL_PKGNAME SWEC_CATALYST_FRIENDLYERROR
- --baseuri is now an alias for --baseurl
- Now makes much better assumptions as to what you want to do when you
	supply a single URI that isn't just a domain on the commandline.
	Ie. swec random.zerodogg.org/swec now becomes:
		Assuming --baseurl http://random.zerodogg.org
		Assuming --urlseed http://random.zerodogg.org/swec
	instead of:
		Assuming --baseurl http://random.zerodogg.org/swec
		Assuming --urlseed /
	You can still use the old behaviour by explicitly using
	--baseurl and --urlseed.
- Fixed an issue where --validate would produce different results from
	when running the actual tests.
- Now performs a http HEAD request before performing the GET request.

SWEC 0.1.1
----------
- Minor fixes to the documnetation
- Dropped the SWEC_STANDARD_ERROR test
- Now processes error pages if present, only falling back to LWP errors
	if that fails. This should give better diagnostics.
- Improved and added various tests
- Minor speedups

SWEC 0.1
--------
- First public release
